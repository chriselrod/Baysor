## [Upcoming]

- Fixed some package versions, dependencies should cause fewer bugs now

## [0.5.1] — 2021-12-01

### Changed

- Slightly optimized compilation time
- Minor updates of core formulas

### Added

- CLI parameter `no-ncv-estimation` to disable estimation of NCVs

## [0.5.0] — 2021-06-03

### Changed

- `scale-std` now can be specified from CLI parameters
- Several bugs fixed
- Allow missing genes in the input data
- Updates in the core algorithm
- All diagnostic plots were updated

### Added

- `exclude-genes` option that removes genes from the data frame before segmentation.
- **Segmentation of compartments based on the list of compartment-specific genes**
- Using information about compartment per molecule in the segmentation algorithm when available
- **3D segmentation**

### Removed

- The data can not be split by frames anymore. *This functionality didn't work well previously and was hard to maintan.*

## [0.4.3] — 2021-04-06

### Changed

- Fixed the CLI installation bug
- More information in logging
- Better initialization for molecule clustering. *This should improve cell separability a lot!*

- Fixed plotting performance by moving to Makie.jl

### Added

- Estimating scale when prior segmentation is provided as a CSV column
- Added the option `--save-polygons=GeoJSON` to save cell boundary polygons in the GeoJSON format

## [0.4.2] — 2020-11-26

### Changed

- Fixed Makefile julia version
- Improved polygon visualization
- Regressed to Plots 1.6.0 because of the performance issues
- Fixed docker build
- Small bug fixes
- `min-molecules-per-segment` parameter is working now
- Fixed visualization of prior segmentation

## [0.4.1] — 2020-10-30

### Added

- Added travis config
- Saving NCV colors to the `ncv_color` field of *segmentation.csv*

### Removed

- Dropped support for julia < 1.5

### Changed

- Updated dependencies
- `find_grid_point_labels_kde` now preserves label ids
- Fixed docker build
- Added ImageMagick dependency to fix problems with DAPI prior
